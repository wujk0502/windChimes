# Wind Chimes 

# Project Overview

Wind Chimes is a powerhouse of senses. It allows users to interact with objects to create music with a wide array of natural sound and offer them with sound visualization. By clicking on different shapes on the wind chimes, users first hear different sounds from rain to cat purring to lava flowing. Then they will notice the sound visualization which displays different amplitude and color at different bandwidths and frequencies. As they continue exploring the sound, they will not only feel relaxed by listening to the nature’s sound but also stay engaged as they test out what types of sound might go well together. A rainy day with thunderstorm rumbles and cow mooing could reflect the mood for a typical Monday evening, while cicada singing accompanied by cat purring would make a perfect cozy Sunday afternoon. When the users are satisfied with a music remix they just created, they can save it and share it with their friends. 

## Key controls:
Pressing the space key allow users to stop the music and recreate it. Pressing UP and Down buttons allow users to increase and decrease the volume. Pressing key “r” will start and stop recording and key “s” will save the music file.  

# Why is this project meaningful to me?
This project is meaningful to me as pendulum is one of the systems that we studied a lot since it has so many important properties (acceleration, angular frequency, etc.) so it gives me great satisfaction to see it generated on Processing. Moreover, as a classical piano and guitar player and a person who loves nature, I found a way to connect all these passions together by intertwining several different human senses. 


# How did this project challenge me?

Firstly, I have never used Processing before, so picking up a new language in a short time was very challenging. Moreover, I thought of playing around with music early on in my brainstorming process, along with many other ideas. I browsed many projects others have posted yet couldn’t arrive at a feasible plan. It was quite challenging to think of a way to make a sound project interactive, beyond just uploading a file. The wind chimes idea eventually hit me and immediately captivated me with memories going back to childhood. It perfectly melts visual and audio into an organic whole and leads users to explore an often-neglected aspect of life – the true sound of nature. By allowing them to save and share the music they created, they project is empowered with self-branding ability. 

# Known Bugs

There are not known bugs that can stop the program. However, in order for Minim to record the music playing, the user needs to enable microphone input on their own computer.
